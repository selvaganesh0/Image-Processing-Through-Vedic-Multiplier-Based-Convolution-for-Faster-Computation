# Image-Processing-Through-Vedic-Multiplier-Based-Convolution-for-Faster-Computation
This project accelerates image processing by performing convolution using an optimized Vedic multiplier. Unlike existing signed-unsigned Vedic multipliers which are slower, the proposed design enhances speed and reduces hardware usage, making it suitable for real-time applications.
